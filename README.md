## üõ†Ô∏è Manual Installation

If the automatic installer doesn't work for you:

1. Make sure Python 3.6+ is installed and in your PATH
2. Install required packages:
   ```
   pip install colorama keyboard fuzzywuzzy python-Levenshtein
   ```

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

**Q: I installed WZF but the `wzf` command is not recognized.**  
A: Open a new PowerShell window. The changes to your profile only apply to new sessions.

**Q: The search is slow when scanning all drives.**  
A: Scanning all drives can take time. Try limiting the search depth with `-d` or search specific directories instead.

**Q: I'm getting permission errors when searching.**  
A: Some system directories require administrator privileges. Run PowerShell as administrator or exclude those directories.
